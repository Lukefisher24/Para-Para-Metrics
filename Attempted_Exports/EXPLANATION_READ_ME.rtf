\f0\fs24 \cf0 I was having trouble exporting the \'93finished\'94 pieces as joined STL\'92s and I figured it would be pointless to export them individually because they imported individually. So I decided to take photographs of the results (when simply \'91complied\'92 and not \'91complied and rendered\'92) and hope that we could sort out the problem at a later date if necessary.\

I hope that this will suffice.}
